# Fetch2Match

Welcome to **Fetch2Match**! This project is a website for dog lovers to search through a database of shelter dogs, with the hope of finding a new home for these dogs. Users can filter by breed, paginate through the results, sort the list, and add dogs to their favorites for matching.

### _NOTE: This is part of a frontend exercise given to me by a certain company. The API that this is linked to is theirs, while the frontend is of my design and development._
